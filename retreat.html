Over dinner, we'll share introductions and prophetic icebreakers that set the tone for authenticity and belonging. The night closes with worship and a commissioning moment that reminds you: you are here on purpose, for such a time as this.</p>

                        <p>The retreat opens with clarity and grounding. This day is about discovering who you are in Christ and why your voice matters. Instead of striving to "find your niche," you'll be gently guided into anchoring your identity and drawing out the testimonies and experiences that carry Kingdom weight.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Devotional: <em>Identity Before Assignment</em> — centering ourselves in truth, followed by a Story Extraction Workshop where you'll uncover 3–5 core stories that have shaped your journey.</li>
                            <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Teaching: <em>What Content Really Is</em> — expanding your view of content from "posts" to the many ways your voice can move through the world. Gentle group brainstorms help you connect your stories to multiple formats.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Story Circles — a safe, Spirit-led space where you share one story and receive encouragement as sisters help you see new ways it can shine.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="outcome">✨ You'll leave Day 1 with your <strong>identity anchored</strong> and a starter <strong>content ecosystem map</strong>—clarity that brings peace instead of pressure.</p>

                        <p>Day 2 moves you from stories into structure. The goal is not more hustle, but rhythm—seeing how your message can flow into a funnel that fits your life and calling. You'll learn to multiply without burning out and create with confidence instead of confusion.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Teaching: <em>Content Funnels = Free → Paid</em> — a simple framework to map one offer and the content that supports it. Workshop time helps you connect the dots between your stories and your services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Teaching: <em>Multiplication Mindset</em> — reframing visibility as stewardship, not stress. Breakouts give you hands-on space in your lane—speakers draft outlines, writers shape blogs and emails, visual creators script reels and b-roll.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evening:</strong> <em>Show & Tell</em> — a night of joy and encouragement, where each woman shares one piece she created that day and receives prophetic affirmation.</li>

                        <p class="outcome">✨ You'll leave Day 2 with a <strong>drafted funnel</strong> and at least one <strong>content piece started</strong>, stepping into a rhythm that feels doable and life-giving.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Devotional: <em>Loaves & Fish Content</em> — a reminder that when you offer what you have, God multiplies it. Mini photo sessions run throughout the morning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Content Lab — an immersive creation block where you record podcasts, film b-roll, draft blogs, and batch reels. You'll be guided and encouraged, but the focus is on actually making it happen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Closing Feast — a celebratory dinner with sparkling cider toasts and a prophetic commissioning circle, where each woman speaks her next 30-day content commitment aloud and is blessed by the group.</li>
