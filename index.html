                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>The Soul Sister Project has always carried a bigger vision than one person or one program. I am barely starting to understand the heartbeat of the Father and the vision He entrusted me with in 1992 at the age of 9.</p>

                    <p>What I do understand decades later, is that He desires to move women from <strong>misunderstood to confident</strong>, from <strong>hidden to visible</strong>, from <strong>silence to story</strong>, from building everyone else's empires to <strong>boldly stepping into their unique identity and calling</strong>.</p>

                    <div class="vision-box">
                        <h3>The Long-Term Vision</h3>
                        <p>Over the next decade, the Soul Sister Project is called to become more than a community — it will grow into a <strong>Kingdom-centered media platform</strong> where women's voices rise together. A place where stories become movements, where authenticity shifts culture, and where women are not just heard but <strong>impossible to ignore</strong>. That vision includes retreats, conferences, publishing, digital media, and platforms that amplify women's voices around the world.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>But every movement begins with a first step. This retreat is that step.</strong></p>

                        <h3>More Than a Retreat</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>Soul Sister Commissioning Retreat</strong> is more than three days of identity, content, and strategy. It's the <strong>first model</strong> of what it looks like to gather in intimacy, commission women into visibility, and equip them with rhythms and assets that make their voices sustainable.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because of the stage we are in, this retreat is being run as <strong>at-cost, shared investment</strong>. There is no profit margin built in — the purpose is to <em>prove the model and seed the movement</em>. You are not being asked to buy a "ticket to an event." You are being invited to <strong>co-create a model</strong> that, if successful, will replicate into larger gatherings, media platforms, and ongoing opportunities.</p>

                        <h3>The Thursday Investment</h3>
                        <p>If you choose to invest in the <strong>Thursday Overflow Upgrade</strong>, you are doing more than giving yourself extra time to integrate and breathe. You are also <strong>sowing a seed into keeping this vision alive</strong>. Thursday is designed as both a spiritual exhale and a practical accelerator, but your investment in it directly helps undergird the sustainability of the Soul Sister Project and this commissioning movement. It is a way of saying yes to <em>your own renewal</em> and yes to <em>the future expansion of this vision</em>.</p>

                        <p>As <strong>founding members</strong>, you are stepping into more than an experience. You are stepping into the roots of the Soul Sister Project's long-term vision. And in time, you will have the opportunity to partner with us, use this model for your own gatherings, or step into the larger expansion as conferences, publishing, and media grow.</p>
